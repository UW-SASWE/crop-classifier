## How-Tos -- TODO
## Developer Notes
### Requirements
The app requires `node.js` (v10 or above) to run on the server and `npm` to install the required packages. We recommend installing `node.js` and `npm` using the Node Version Manager (`nvm`) for [Unix, MacOS and Windows WSL](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Windows OS](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

### Server Setup
After installing `node.js` and `npm`, activate the `node.js` by running `nvm use 10` (where 10 stands for the version number). Run `npm install` to install the required packages on the server.
